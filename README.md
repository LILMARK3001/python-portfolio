Thonny House Price Predict:

I want to the AI to predict house prices, and it matters since it can help with numbers


It works by using numbers from a google sheets csv file to predict the prices


I used Thonny and google sheets


It did work and and was accurate and the output was good


From this project I learned how to use more complex AI code and what I can do with it
